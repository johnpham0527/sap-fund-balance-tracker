# sap-fund-balance-tracker
Given a list of SAP fund codes, this Python script outputs the fund balance from an exported Excel file from SAP.

For my work as a Senior Manager of Institutional Giving, I am tasked with tracking the grant fund balances for dozens of grants. This task is important because I need to regularly see whether our organization's current grants are being spent down at an appropriate rate (i.e., not too quickly or not too slowly).

Prior to writing this script, I completed this grant management task manually by looking up each fund code in SAP, viewing the balance, and then recording the balance into an Excel tracking spreadsheet.

This script has saved me time by automating the process. The script outputs the balances into a "scrap" worksheet that I verify and then copy and paste into the tracking spreadsheet.
