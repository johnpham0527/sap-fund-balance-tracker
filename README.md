# sap-fund-balance-tracker
Given a list of SAP fund codes, this Python script outputs the fund balance from an exported Excel file from SAP.

At work, I am tasked with tracking the grant fund balances for dozens of grants. Prior to writing this script, I completed this task by looking up each fund code in SAP, viewing the balance, and then recording the balance into an Excel tracking spreadsheet.

This script saves me time by automating this task. The script outputs the balances into a "scrap" worksheet that I verify and then copy and paste into the tracking spreadsheet.
